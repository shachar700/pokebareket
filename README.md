# Pokémon Bareket

This is a decompilation of Pokémon Emerald. It is currently getting modified to allow Hebrew language compatibility, and later getting translated to Hebrew.

If you'd like to contribute coding or Hebrew translations, please do contact me on Discord (I'm shachar700) with a purposeful message.

It builds the following ROM:

* [**pokebareket.gba**](https://datomatic.no-intro.org/index.php?page=show_record&s=23&n=1961) `sha1: f3ae088181bf583e55daf962a92bb46f4f1d07b7`

To set up the repository, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).
